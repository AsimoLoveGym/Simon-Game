## Game Rules:

Itâ€™s the classical Simon game. It will demo the pattern first, you follow the patter and click each block. Successfully doing so will lead you to next level.

###Game difficulty
Default game difficulty is Hard (20 steps in total to win the game). You can use the dropdown menu to choose other difficulties (9 steps or 15 steps).

###Game mode
In normal mode, you will stay in the same level if you clicked wrong.

In strick mode, you will go back to level 0 if you clicked wrong.

###Others

Switch on/off works as the real switch in life.

Start button can reset game to level 0 and start from beginning.

Tempo will speed up after level 5, 9 and 13.
